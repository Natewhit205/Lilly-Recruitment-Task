# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

***Not every section in this document is required. This is just a template to help get you started. Feel free to add or remove sections as you feel necessary.***

## Approach
First I decided that it would probably be best to place every html element I would need on the screen first then alter it with the JavaScript. I read all of the objects upfront so I had an overall idea of everything I would need to plan for and how I could implement them. I then went through the objectives one-by-one to make sure everything was covered. After that I went over the css file to make the interface friendly. Initially I had to look into how to fetch the data from within JavaScript, but I was familiar with what it meant from the server side. Once I had that figured out, worked on writing the function to update the table from what was received.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
When I initially wrote the searchHandler function it had more lines than I would have liked, so I went over it to try and condense anything that I felt could be moved elsewhere.
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*
